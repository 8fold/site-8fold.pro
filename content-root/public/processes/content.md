1. [Add SSL encryption to domain](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview)
2. Update `.htaccess` file to include the Force HTTPS content.

# Force HTTPS
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301,NE]
Header always set Content-Security-Policy "upgrade-insecure-requests;"
```
