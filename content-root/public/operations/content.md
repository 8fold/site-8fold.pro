# Operations and Culture

Legally: 8fold operates as a single-member limited liability company registered in the state of Tennessee.

Financially: 8fold operates as a not-for-profit cooperative of micro-business owners.

Why the division?

A single-member [.limited liability company](LLC) is a more flexible business structure than a formal not-for-profit or nonprofit operation. While we have not ruled out the future possibility, there is nothing stopping us from internally operating as a not-for-profit entity despite not being legally required to.

This fits squarely within the bounds of our culture.

## Culture 

We take a deliberate, holistic, and iterative approach to our culture. Our culture begins with the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/); replacing each instance of the word "software" with the word "solutions." We extend the Manifesto with our own values, principles, and practices.

### Values

**Agency:** We acknowledge you by enabling the realization of what is meaningful to you.

**Humility:** We avoid jealousy and condescension between people. Do not try to be better or worse than others, try to be better than who you were yesterday.

**Community:** We engage in relationships to increase connection and belonging while treating you with compassion.

**Evolution:** We make deliberate decisions regarding what to change and to what extent in order to continuously improve.

**Agility:** We do what we can to increase our ability to absorb change given our varying context.

**The Tao of Productivity:** We strive to balance efficiency, effectiveness, scope, and speed in a way that works for us.

### Principles

**Time is the only commodity that matters.**

**If we aren’t inspired by it, it’s difficult to inspire others.**

**Trying to please everyone inspires no one.**

**No task is above or below a practitioner.**

**Complex systems emerge from simple rules and goals.**

**Danger is real—fear is a choice.**

**Pulling is generally met with less friction than pushing.**

**Working at 100% utilization is not a noble goal.**

**Don’t be a weasel.** Don’t talk negatively about anyone if they are not in the room with no intent of interaction _with_ that person \(or you have not already discussed the topic with them).

**The Community Principle.** If you create, acquire, or use "it," you help maintain "it."

### Practices

The following practices are used to embody and encourage our values and principles.

**Continuously assess if something agrees with or contradicts our values, principles, and practices.** If a user believes there is dissonance between something at 8fold and our values, principles, and practices, that user is encouraged to say or act in order to improve it.

**Ask if the reason behind something is still valid.** We believe the _‘why’_ behind things is important. Further, in keeping with our core value of evolution, if the _why_ behind anything appears invalid, the thing itself is invalid. Finally, if the _why_ emerges again, it may be necessary to “dust off” what was put away.

**All Practitioners are Members, but not all Members are Practitioners.** Members believe in the mission of 8fold and show support through earning Folds.

**Members choose their individual work.** If a Member determines a task is beyond their level of knowledge, ability, or passion, they may ask another to teach or take on the task. However, no Member has the authority to assign a task to someone else.

**Create intentional conflict norms.**

**Results only work environment.** It's your life. You are a professional. You are the most qualified to determine what you're working on and when. Your fellow users have no right, obligation, or authority to watch over you without your permission.

**Transparency with confidentiality.**

**Practitioners own the products of their minds; 8fold owns trade marks, names, and marketing collateral.** The intellectual property policies of most organizations tend to protect the organization should someone leave over protecting or helping the employee should the organization let them go.

**“Final” does not exist.** Final implies a thing will never change and cannot be improved. It is what it is; further, is it as it should be?

**Knowledge sharing over knowledge hoarding.**

**Practitioners do not work directly with any government organization under the 8fold banner.**
