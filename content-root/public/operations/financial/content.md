# 8fold Financial Procedures

## Inflows

All money coming into 8fold flows into the Income Account. We treat income in three ways:

1. fees and dues,
2. Practitioner revenue, and
3. Open Source Software Support.

### General Fund (Fees and Dues)

Includes membership dues and any pass-through costs for other services billed through 8fold's accounts. For example, if a Practitioner registers a website domain name billed to 8fold, the cost is considered a fee above and beyond the membership dues.

These funds are considered direct revenue, and we apply a 30-30-30-10 approach to distributing to other fund accounts:

1. 30 percent goes to the Tax Preparation Account.
2. 30 percent goes to the Runway Account.
3. 30 percent goes to the Distribution Account.
4. 10 percent goes to the Endowment Fund.

If the Runway and Distribution Accounts are .

### Practitioner [.Preparation](Prep.) Fund (Practitioner Revenue)

Practitioners have the option to send revenue generated from the sale of their products and services to 8fold (similar to a fiscal host). These funds are considered indirect revenue, and we apply a 90-10 approach to distributing to other fund accounts:

1. 90 percent goes to the Practitioner Preparation Fund.
2. 10 percent is placed in the General Fund, and the distributions are made.

It is likely Practitioners will invoice 8fold to receive the 90 percent. Therefore, it will appear as an expense on the Ledger for tax purposes.

### Open Source Software Support Fund

Some Practitioners create [.Open Source Software](OSS) and may elect to have that software placed under the 8fold organization on various platforms.

1. 85 percent becomes Practitioner Revenue
2. 10 percent goes to support the direct dependencies (development or otherwise) of the OSS project.
3. 5 percent goes to support nonprofit organizations supported by 8fold.

## Outflows

### General Fund (Expenses)

Operational expenses are covered by multiple accounts that collectively make up the General Fund. If, for some reason, there is both enough money in the General Fund to cover all 8fold liabilities, 

### Tax Preparation Fund

If taxes are owed annually (or quarterly), they will be paid out of the Tax Preparation Fund. A portion of the remaining
