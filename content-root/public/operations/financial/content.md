# 8fold Financial Procedures

## Inflows

All money coming into 8fold flows into the Income Account. We treat income in three ways:

1. fees and dues,
2. Practitioner revenue, and
3. Open Source Software Support.

### Fees and Dues

Includes membership dues and any pass-through costs for other services billed through 8fold's accounts. For example, if a Practitioner registers a website domain name billed to 8fold, the cost is considered a fee above and beyond the membership dues.

These funds are considered direct revenue, and we apply a 30-30-30-10 approach to distributing to other fund accounts:

1. 30 percent goes to the Tax Preparation Fund.
2. 30 percent goes to the Runway Fund.
3. 30 percent goes to the Distribution Fund.
4. 10 percent goes to the Endowment Fund.

### Practitioner Revenue

Practitioners have the option to send revenue generated from the sale of their products and services to 8fold (similar to a fiscal host). These funds are considered indirect revenue, and we apply a 90-10 approach to distributing to other fund accounts:

1. 90 percent goes to the Practitioner Preparation Fund.
2. 10 percent is converted to direct revenue and processed as "Fees and dues."

It is likely that Practitioners will invoice 8fold to receive the 90 percent. Therefore, it will appear as an expense on the Ledger.

### Open Source Software Support

Practitioners create [.Open Source Software](OSS) and may elect to have that software placed under the 8fold organization on various platforms.

1. 85 percent become Practitioner Revenue
2. 10 percent goes to support the direct dependencies (development or otherwise) of the OSS project.
3. 5 percent goes to support nonprofit organizations supported by 8fold.
