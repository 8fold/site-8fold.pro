# 8fold Financial Procedures

## Inflows

All money coming into 8fold flows into the Income Account. We treat income in three ways:

1. fees and dues,
2. Practitioner revenue, and
3. Open Source Software Support.

### General Fund (Fees and Dues)

Includes membership dues and any pass-through costs for other services billed through 8fold's accounts. For example, if a Practitioner registers a website domain name billed to 8fold, the cost is considered a fee above and beyond the membership dues.

These funds are considered direct revenue, and we apply a 30-30-30-10 approach to distributing to other fund accounts:

1. 30 percent goes to the Tax Preparation Account.
2. 30 percent goes to the Runway Account.
3. 30 percent goes to the Distribution Account.
4. 10 percent goes to the Endowment Fund.

If the Runway and Distribution Accounts are at their target minimum balances, excess will be placed in the Endowment Fund.

### Practitioner [.Preparation](Prep.) Fund (Practitioner Revenue)

Practitioners have the option to process revenue generated from the sale of their products and services through 8fold (similar to a fiscal host). Money processed this way is considered indirect revenue, and we apply a 90-10 split to distributing to other Funds:

1. 90 percent goes to the Practitioner Preparation Fund.
2. 10 percent is placed in the General Fund, and the distributions are made.

### Open Source Software Support Fund

Some Practitioners create [.Open Source Software](OSS) and may elect to have that software placed under the 8fold organization on various platforms.

1. 85 percent is moved to the Practitioner Prep. Fund.
2. 10 percent goes to support the direct dependencies (development or otherwise) of the OSS project.
3. 5 percent goes to support nonprofit organizations supported by 8fold.

## Outflows

### General Fund (Expenses)

Operational expenses are covered by multiple accounts that collectively make up the General Fund. If, for some reason, there is not enough money in the General Fund to cover all 8fold liabilities, we pull from the Distribution Fund followed by the Endowment Fund.

### Practitioner Prep. Fund

Practitioners invoice 8fold to receive the 90 percent owed to them. Invoices received will result in money being transferred from the Practitioner Prep. Fund to the General Fund. Practitioners may also request a portion of the 90 percent goes to other 8fold Funds and projects.

### Open Source Software Support Fund

85 percent is moved to the Practitioner Prep. Fund. 15 percent is moved to the general ledger for distribution to third parties.

### Tax Preparation Fund

8fold files taxes annually (or quarterly) in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws.

If taxes are owed, 8fold transfers the amount from the Tax Preparation Fund to the General Fund. 80 percent or less of the remaining balance in the Tax Preparation Fund is transferred to the General Fund in accordance with the flow described above; ignoring the 30 percent to the Tax Preparation Fund.
