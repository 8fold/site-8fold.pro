# Fold System

All Members earn Folds per 8fold [user agreements](/legal/user-agreements).

The Fold System is a blend of the human body's Limbic and Endocrine Systems. Or, if that analogy doesn't work for you, it's a way to give 8fold the means to inform decision-making, recognize Members for their individual contributions, and facilitate alternative trading. The Fold System also solves multiple problems and functions seen in traditional businesses without the overhead and resource requirements.

Folds earned in a given month determine your Fold Level for the following month. (Your first month is an exception to this rule.)

## Earning Folds

You must be a Member to earn Folds.

There are two ways to earn Folds through contribution: money or time.

<details>
<summary>Dues and fees (required)</summary>

[Sign up for a "Membership" tier](https://opencollective.com/8fold/contribute). Every dollar spent earns you one Fold.

Note: Money given directly to a Practitioner, another member, or for non-8fold Services does not earn you Folds.

Scenario:

1. You sign up for the Friend tier.
2. You are charged 16 [.United States Dollars](USD) (Plus any fees, taxes, and tips to the processing platform).
3. You earn 16 Folds.

</details>

<details>
<summary>One-time donation or purchase</summary>

A one-time monetary contribution to 8fold is made, one Fold earned per dollar spent.

Scenario one (donation):

1. As a Member, you make a one-time donation of 50 USD.
2. You are charged 50 USD.
3. You earn 50 Folds.

Scenario two (purchase):

1. You spend 100 USD with a Practitioner who uses 8fold infrastructure to facilitate the transaction.
2. 8fold receives 100 USD from you, less any processing fees, to be used in accordance with 8fold [bookkeeping and investment procedures](/operations/financial/).
2. The *Practitioner* earns 100 Folds and may invoice 8fold up to 90 USD for your purchase.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Trade</summary>

You provide a product or service to another Member. Instead of monetary payment, you both agree to trade Folds.

Example:

1. Member A needs design work done.
2. Member A offers Member B 100 Folds instead of monetary payment, and Member B agrees.
3. Member A transfers 100 Folds to Member B and receives the completed work.
4. Member B's Fold balance increases by 100 Folds.
5. No cash or cash equivalents have exchanged hands.

</details>

## Fold Levels

Your Fold Level is determined by your Fold balance.

1. Oct: 20,000 Folds or more.
2. Quad: Less than 20,000 Folds.
3. Double: Less than 9,600.
4. Full: Less than 4,800.
5. Half: Less than 2,400.
6. Quarter: Less than 1,200.
7. None: Less than 600. (Does not qualify for [revenue redistribution](/legal/#revenue-redistribution-policy))

### Decay Rate

"Decay" is a misnomer. It would be more accurate to say that if a Fold is held in the same Member's account for a certain period, it will be transferred to 8fold's Fold account based on the following timing.

1. Oct: No longer than one month, regardless of how much over 20,000 Folds the balance is.
2. Quad: 4 months.
3. Double: 8 months.
4. Full: 16 months.
5. Half: 32 months.
6. Quarter: 40 months.

Revenue redistribution, if applicable, occurs on the first of each month. The decay rate is applied following the calculation for the revenue redistribution amount.

Scenario one (continued contribution):

1. You sign up to be a member for 32 USD per month.
2. You earn 32 Folds in month one.
3. 19 months later, you become a Quarter Fold with 608 Folds.
4. On the first day of month 20, you qualify for revenue redistribution.
5. 8fold will notify you of whether a distribution event is occurring.
	- If 8fold is having a distribution event, you can opt-in to receiving it.
	- Otherwise, if 8fold does not have a distribution event, the decay rate will not apply.
6. If 8fold had a distribution event, whether you opt-in or not, the decay rate is applied.

Note: Folds must decay in whole-number increments. If the decay calculation results in a fractional amount, 8fold will record it but not reduce your Fold balance until the total is greater than or equal to 1.

Scenario two (one-time contribution of 25,000 USD):

1. You contribute 25,000 USD to 8fold.
2. You earn 25,000 Folds in month one and become an Oct Fold.
3. On the first day of month two, you qualify for revenue redistribution.
4. 8fold will notify you (see Scenario One, step 5).
5. If 8fold has a distribution event, whether you opt-in or not, the decay rate is applied, resulting in your Fold balance dropping to 19,999 Folds.
6. Repeat steps 3 through 5, dropping from Quad to Double to Full to Half to Quarter to None.

In other words, if you contributed 25,000 USD once, you would qualify for revenue redistribution for roughly 100 months.

## Calculating the Distribution Pool

8fold maintains a portfolio (think endowment) consisting of short-term (think cash), growth, negatively correlated, and low-correlation assets. Each asset category has a target percentage it should occupy within the overall portfolio. Only short-term assets may be used to create the Distribution Pool.

Scenario one (short-term assets should be 6 percent of the portfolio, the value of the portfolio is 100,000 USD, operating expenses of 2,000 USD for the past 12 months, and short-term assets valued at 20,000 USD):

1. 20,000 USD in short-term assets.
2. 1,000 USD in liabilities, which will be paid, leaving 19,000 USD in short-term assets.
3. 667 USD for the runway (2,000 / 12 * 3), leaving 18,333 USD in short-term assets (18,000 - 667).
	- If this results in a negative number, a distribution event will not occur, Members will be notified, and the decay rate will *not* be applied.
4. 12,333 for Distribution Pool (18,333 - (100,000 * 6%)).
	- Members will be notified that a distribution event will occur and what they qualify for.

## Performing the Distribution Event

1. Each Fold Level has a corresponding numeric value. We divide the Distribution Pool by the sum of the numeric values of each Member's Fold Level and round the result down to the nearest whole number. This gives us the amount to be distributed to each Full Fold Member. 8fold multiplies that number by the numeric value of your Fold Level to determine how much you qualify for during this Distribution Event.
2. 8fold will send you a notification.
3. You have 72 hours to opt-in to the Distribution Event.
	- If you do not opt-in to the Distribution Event, the amount that would have been sent to you will be folded (see what we did there?) back into the portfolio.
	- If you opt-in, you will receive the funds.

Scenario (four members, 12,333 USD in the Distribution Pool, and one Member doesn't opt-in):

1. John is Quarter.
2. Suzy is Full.
3. José is Double.
4. Gita is Oct.

We have 11.25 Folds represented (0.25 + 1 + 2 + 8). A Full Fold would receive 1,096 USD (12,333 / 11.25 rounded down to the first whole number). We notify the Members of what they qualify for:

1. John would receive 274 (1,096 * 0.25)
2. Suzy 1,096 (1,096 * 1)
3. José 2,192 (1,096 * 2)
4. Gita 8,768 (1,096 * 8)

Total to distribute: 12,330 USD.

All Members except Suzy opt-in to receive their distribution, and they do. The 1,096 USD that would have gone to Suzy plus the 3 USD remaining in the Distribution Pool is used to purchase one or more of the assets in the portfolio to bring the portfolio into balance.
